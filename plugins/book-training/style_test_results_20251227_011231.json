Melanctha had begun to see some men, a little, in these days, but she had not yet learned to feel any safety in them. And so the feeling of her oneness with the world of men was still not very strong in her. And this feeling of her oneness with them was still the only way that Melanctha knew how to find peace in her.\n\nAnd so one night, late, Melanctha was sitting in her room, very tired, and feeling very lonely. It was the first night of the new moon, and the stars were very bright above her. Melanctha was very tired, and she sat there and she began to wonder if she should go to sleep. She sat there and looked at the stars a long time. She did not seem to see them very clearly. She was tired, and it was very lonely there inside her. At last she took out her little black book and began to read in it. Her fingers closed hard upon it and then they opened very slowly as she turned the pages. She stopped a good deal in her reading, and she did not seem to see much in what she was reading. She was very tired, and her heart was very heavy, and she felt very lonely. She was very tired, and at last she fell asleep.\n\nMelanctha woke up at last, and it was morning. She got up and took a warm bath, and then she came and sat down at the kitchen table and began on the jigsaw puzzle. She worked on it a long time, but she did not seem to see much in what she was"
