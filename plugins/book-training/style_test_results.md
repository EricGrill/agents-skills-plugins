**Output:**

It was a very lonely time, all these days, for poor Melanctha Herbert. Melanctha had begun to see some men, a little, in these days, but she had not yet learned to feel any safety in them. And so the feeling of her oneness with the world of men was still not very strong in her. And this feeling of her oneness with them was still the only way that Melanctha knew how to find peace in her.

And so one night, late, Melanctha was sitting in her room, very tired, and feeling very lonely. It was the first night of the new moon, and the stars were very bright above her. Melanctha was very tired, and she sat there and she began to wonder if she should go to sleep. She sat there and looked at the stars a long time. She did not seem to see them very clearly. She was tired, and it was very lonely there inside her. At last she took out her little black book and began to read in it. Her fingers closed hard upon it and then they opened very slowly as she turned the pages. She stopped a good deal in her reading, and she did not seem to see much in what she was reading. She was very tired, and her heart was very heavy, and she felt very lonely. She was very tired, and at last she fell asleep.

Melanctha woke up at last, and it was morning. She got up and took a warm bath, and then she came and sat down at the kitchen table and began on the jigsaw puzzle. She worked on it a long time, but she did not seem to see much in what she was

In these days, when everybody worked from home, it was very simple for the Curden girls to take care of Mrs. Lehntman.

The elder daughter who was a spinster, and the younger who was still in school, both did what they could to help their friend. They did not, of course, take her wages, but they worked very hard to make Mrs. Lehntman easy, and to do everything that they could to help her through this bad time.

It was a bad time for poor Mrs. Lehntman. Her savings were just about all gone. She had not a cent to put aside for the future.

Mrs. Lehntman was a good and kind of woman, sweet tempered, gentle, and very german. She was a little under made. She was not large in any of her body members. She had a good head, clear skin, and very pretty, regular, sweet smiling face. Mrs. Lehntman was a little in her sixties. She had been a midwife most of her working life.

Mrs. Lehntman was very good and very pleasant and very easy to direct.

Mrs. Lehntman was very good and very pleasant and very easy to direct. The Curden girls found all this very simple to do.

It was a little different taking care of Mrs. Lehntman than it had been taking care of Mrs. Aldrich. Here there was no one to be put on the board to take care of things for you. Mrs. Lehntman was helpless in her mind and body. She could not make decisions, she could not do things for herself

**Output:**
```
The first week went very smoothly. Mrs. Lehntman was very well content with this new way of doing.

Then it came that the young fellow was no longer a student, and he had more time when he was not working. Still they did not seem to get on much better together in the car. One day the young fellow had been detained somewhere, and he was late in coming to meet Mrs. Lehntman. She was very angry when she saw him. She told him she never wanted to see him any more in her car. She told him he was very bad to her and she never did want to see him any more that way. The poor young fellow really was very sorry and he begged her to let him be excused for that one day, and all the rest of that week, too, so he could make it good to her. Mrs. Lehntman was very good to him and she said she was sure he had a good reason for it. She told him if he had any more trouble with her she would never want to see him any more, but she was sure he had a good reason for it.

All this time the good german cook was keeping Mrs. Lehntman company on her Sundays. She had first invited Mrs. Lehntman to her house for Sunday afternoons. Soon Mrs. Lehntman began to take her Sundays out in the car. They went a good deal together, just the two of them, and they got on very well together in the car.

## Modern Relationships

### Dating App

**Prompt:** Write like Gertrude Stein: A woman swipes through a dating app, hoping to find connection but feeling hollow.

**Output:**
```
The woman had many times before tried to make herself believe in the power of this kind of way of meeting, but it never had had any real attraction for her. She had no way really to feel things, she had no way to remember anything that had happened to her, and so this life that was so full for everybody was just empty space for her.

She was a large, good natured, ugly woman, with a soft face, lined hands and body, and a dull and lifeless mind.

She had tried the easy way, of taking a husband. She had tried the hard way, of trying to make a living for herself. She had tried to be regular and save up all her wages, and she had tried to live so as to have no children, and so have a little money always, but it had not worked out any better for her.

She had tried all the various ways that poor people have to make a living, and none of them had ever helped her to make ends meet.

She had no health, or any habits that could make life more easy for her. She had not enough strength in her to work hard, and so she could not make a living.

She was a woman who had not enough life to keep herself from being really dirty, but she had a good mind, and she was kind, and she always liked to do things for people.

She liked to go out on the weekends, and she would see the men, and she would like them, and then she would go back to her house and tell everything to her doctor.

She had no way to get excited. She had no way to remember. She had no way to feel things. She just had the way she always had had

In this day and age, when everybody was always on the go and had little time to meet each other, and when long letters were going the way of the dinosaur, and when everybody who had any feeling was always using text messages to keep in touch, it was in this way that Lena and Herman were always talking to each other.

"Hey, Herman, I just got a minute to be gone from my patient. Want to talk to you for a little while, Herman," Lena wrote one night, and then she sent the text to him.

Herman read it and then he wrote her back, "I was just getting ready to go to bed, Lena. Want me to come and see you tomorrow, Lena. Want me to bring something to you, Lena. Want me to bring you some ice cream, Lena. Want me to bring you some of those little donuts that you like so much, Lena. Want me to bring you anything else you want me to bring you, Lena. Let me know, Lena."

Lena thought about it for a little while. She was not sure yet that she wanted to see him. She thought about it a long time. She finally decided that she did want to see him. She decided that she would tell him about it the next time she saw him.

She wrote him back, "Sure, Herman, I'd like to see you. I'll be home alone tomorrow night. You come around to the house at eight o'clock. I'll be there to meet you. I think we'll go out for a little while, Herman. I think we'll just talk to each other, Herman. I think we'll be very good friends again, Herman. I certainly do think

It was this young man's firm that had the big new buildings on the water front, and in these buildings they had a large number of women and girls working. It was this young man's firm that had the big new buildings on the water front, and in these buildings they had a large number of women and girls working.

The young man always liked to talk to the girls, but he did not ever think that he could like any one of them. He did not ever think that he could feel any way he could call it love. But talking to them always helped him with his thinking. It gave him something to do with all that time that he had, always with no work to do, just waiting, and yet not being lazy, for he was so much above that kind of waiting.

And then, too, he liked to hear them talk about their homes and their way of life, and he liked to see how they saved up all their money, and though they worked hard, they did not seem to him to have any kind of life that could ever make things really different.

The young man's father was a very steady worker. He worked as a deck hand on a coasting steamer, and he was very good and very steady, and he never tried to do things that he had no business to be doing.

```
The young people of today are very worried about what is going on with the earth. They talk all the time about what they can do to help to make things better. Often they talk about how they can make people understand about not wanting to have so much to use up of all the things that make our world so lovely, and about not wanting to have new things all the time, and about wanting to go so far in making things better that they will not have to have new things any more to be made, and about not wanting to have so much to use up of the earth, in order that they may not have to do so much to keep from having new things all the time, and about how they can make people understand all this so they will not be so much in this worrying, and about how everybody should do their part to make things better.

And so the young people try to make everybody see that it is no good to be always wanting to have new things, and they try to make everybody see that they must not be so wasteful in the use of everything, and they try to make everybody see that they must not always have so much to be worrying, and they try to make everybody see that they must not always be so eager to have new things, and they try to make everybody see that they must do all they can to help to keep the earth from being so much worked over, and they try to make everybody see that they must not always have so much to be in such a worrying way, and they try to make everybody see that they must not always have so much to be in such a worrying way, and they try to make everybody see that they must not always have so much to be in such a
